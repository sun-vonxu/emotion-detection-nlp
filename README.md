![Emotion Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Emotion%20Detection-NLP-blue?style=flat&logo=github)

Welcome to the **Emotion Detection NLP** project! This repository focuses on detecting emotions from text using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, and fear through traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning models.

## Introduction

Emotion detection from text is a crucial aspect of understanding human communication. With the rise of social media and digital interactions, analyzing emotions can provide valuable insights into public sentiment, customer feedback, and mental health assessments. This project employs various models to classify emotions effectively, making it a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in emotion detection.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sun-vonxu/emotion-detection-nlp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd emotion-detection-nlp
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Models Used

### Machine Learning Models

This project utilizes traditional machine learning models, including:

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)**: A simple yet effective model for text classification.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A robust model that works well for high-dimensional data.

### Deep Learning Models

We also implement advanced deep learning models, such as:

- **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)**: A type of recurrent neural network that captures long-range dependencies in text.
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A transformer-based model that excels in understanding context in language.

## Data Preparation

Data preparation is a critical step in building an emotion detection model. This project uses a labeled dataset containing text samples with corresponding emotion labels. The following steps outline the data preparation process:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather text data from various sources such as social media, reviews, or datasets available online.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Remove unnecessary characters, stop words, and perform tokenization.
3. **Label Encoding**: Convert emotion labels into numerical format for model training.
4. **Train-Test Split**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

## Usage

Once you have set up the project and prepared your data, you can start using the models. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Train the Model**: Run the training script to train your selected model.

   ```bash
   python train.py --model <model_name> --data <data_path>
   ```

   Replace `<model_name>` with either `mnb`, `svm`, `bilstm`, or `bert`, and `<data_path>` with the path to your dataset.

2. **Evaluate the Model**: After training, you can evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model <model_name> --data <test_data_path>
   ```

3. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new text data.

   ```bash
   python predict.py --model <model_name> --text "<your_text_here>"
   ```

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of the models, we use several evaluation metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
